Mysql
=====
The authentication has changed from mysql V8, you must use a compatible client and server.  
BTW it's a bug : <https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=91828>

Here is a workaround without uninstalling the new workbench:
  
The most probable case is having an old server with a new workbench:

1. get the server version

From a SQL cli tool:
 
    SHOW VARIABLES LIKE "%version%";

or from a cli connected on the server:

    $ mysql -v

It should show a version < 8.0, in my case 5.1.73

2. Get the mysqlWorkbench for a version <8.0:
  You cannot install the msi if you already have a workbench V8.0, so you have to choose  a portable installation form a zip file here:

https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/6.1.html

Select the version 6.2.5 (last before v8.0) zip version
Unzip
Close the workbench v.8.0 (it lock any other workbench launch)
Launch the V6.2.3 version of workbench, it should works.
