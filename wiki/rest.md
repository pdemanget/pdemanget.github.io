how to test REST urls?

Curl
----
The cli tool. Most GUI tool can generate the cli for you.


Postman
-------
The most known one.


Chrome
------
I'm using Talend API tester


Firefox
-------
I'm using RestClient
The usage is simple: Method, url, headers(from menu) with auto-completion for content-type. Another menu to add favorite with only: name, tag. I like the quick usage.
The curl CLI is displayed below, works in linux or windows-git-bash. I personnaly save this for test, it's more universal if others use other tools (postman...) but you can also export your favorites.
