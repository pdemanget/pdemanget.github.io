how to start documentation
--------------------------
real quickstart:

then
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_adhoc.html
then
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks.html#working-with-playbooks
then
https://github.com/ansible/ansible-examples
maybe
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_filters.html#filters-for-formatting-data



https://docs.ansible.com/?extIdCarryOver=true&sc_cid=701f2000001OH7YAAW
Just take a look to ref variables
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/config.html#ansible-configuration-settings-locations
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/scenario_guides/guide_docker.html

Occasionally you’ll encounter a device that doesn’t support SFTP. This is rare, but should it occur, you can switch to SCP mode in Configuring Ansible.

Ansible guided start
-----------------
There are many documentations on ansible. and the quickstart give an overview. I wanted to make an easy abstract of all the totiral I've read.
This is not a tutorial, only a set of commands taht will work on any machine (running docker, do i forget one?)

1. First: start the hosts we wil plug ansible to. This is just an easy way to get host if you don't ave test hosts, we wil not use these script in production
cd docker-host
$ docker-compose up

now we have 10 openssh server available with ssh root@127.0.0.1 -p10x22  (with x=0-9)
You can also start Vagrant image if you prefer. (in vagrant folder)

2. Then test some ansible command to get familiar with it
configure your hosts by setting se variable ANSIBLE_INVENTORY 
( you could also use the /etc/ansible/hosts file, the point is to configure yor files)
export ANSIBLE_INVENTORY=/home/pdemanget/ansible_hosts
export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=false

ansible all -m ping 
ansible all -a "/bin/echo hello"
ansible all -a "cat /etc/hostname"  
ansible localhost -m ping -e 'ansible_python_interpreter="/usr/bin/env python"'

ansible-inventory webservers   --graph 

see from documentation what happens whith these commands

3. Playing with playbooks

There are some concepts to understand: To run a playbook we will need both the inventory and the playbook, here is the example:

The playbook rely on documented commands, and roles, here is some doc:
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html

$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml -e app_name=example -e app_version=1.0.1 -e env=test -t install



### small tips
import/include things: example: import_playbook

import a playbook from a playbook
    - import_playbook: "setup.yml"
    
    
  run roles for a group hosts
  
  - hosts: preprod-pgpool, prod-pgpool
  # strategy: debug
  tasks:

    - name: "Install and configure pgpool server"
      import_role:
        name: linux/centos/pgpool
        tasks_from: main
      vars:
        _pgpool_use_watchdog: "{{ pgpool_use_watchdog }}"
tags:
        - pgpool
        
        
        
#### Roles folder architecture:
  -defaults
  -tasks
  -vars
  
#### Use variables & jinja2
